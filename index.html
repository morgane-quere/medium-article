    <h3>Yesterday I ate an apple</h3>
    <p>Day... a lot as beeing a parent, I can't remember the last time that I had the priviledge to eat a full apple all by myself. Did it really ever happen one day ? ... too far to remember.</p>
    <p>Speacking of apple, do you know that apples contain alcohol? Amazingly borring right?</p>
    <p>What is the definition of an apple by the way? Can you believe that they paid a guy to write a dummy definition about a borring fruit one day?</p>
    <p>"A round fruit with firm, white flesh and a green, red, or yellow skin". Yep, that's the definition. It would really help an alien to perfectly figure out what it is, won't it? I wonder if someone ever had the need to read it.</p>   
    <h3>Snow is white</h3>
    <p>So cold these days. It's as if they locked us in a fridge. Oh wait, my fridge is hotter! Who cares ? Well if you know someone who does, tell me (or not, please do not) beacause I really don't. I wonder what I can eat tonight. What do I have in my fridge? I think I have some carrots, potatoes... so maybe a soup?</p>

    <h3>Haha you really thought it was gonna work?</h3>
    <p>But nooooooooo! You're stuck here!!!!!!!! Wait... you're not stucked at all! So why do you read that shit? Even I am not interested in what I wrote so why do you waist your time reading it? Don't you have something more interesting to do? </p>
    <p>Well I think I wrote enough bullshit for today. Bye bye bro! Enjoy your life and take care!</p>
